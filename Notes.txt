Classification Algorithms:

Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machines
Decission Trees
K-Nearest Neighbors
Random Forests
Logistic Regression


Steps:

1. Problem Statement (Determine Gender based on Name)
2. Features. In this step we identify a characteristic and assign a numerical value. 
	2.1. Last letter is vowel/consonant (0/1)
	2.2. Number of characters 
	2.3. Presense of prefixes/suffuxes common to a gender (Ms/Mr/Mrs/Smt/Sri)
	2.4. A lot of thought needs to go into what kind of features we need to use. Getting this right need trial and error sometimes.
3. Training - feed to algorithm.
4. Test

Improving model:
Larger dataset
Different Pipeline: Different learner, different transform, different hyperparameters
